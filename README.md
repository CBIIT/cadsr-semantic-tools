Welcome to the caDSR Semantic Tools Project!
=====================================

The Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW) is a caCORE tool that assists users in adding consistent metadata to a UML model, or verifying consistency, by tagging their domain model with matching concepts from the NCI Thesaurus. This process helps bring the UML model semantically in-line with other registered caCORE-like systems, allowing for easier data-sharing between distributed systems.
