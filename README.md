Welcome to the caDSR Semantic Tools Project!
=====================================

The Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW) is a [caCORE] (https://github.com/NCIP/cacore-sdk) tool that assists 
users in adding consistent metadata to a UML model, or verifying consistency, by tagging their domain model with 
matching concepts from the NCI Thesaurus. This process helps bring the UML model semantically in-line with other 
registered caCORE-like systems, allowing for easier data-sharing between distributed systems.

The caDSR Semantic Tools project is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
