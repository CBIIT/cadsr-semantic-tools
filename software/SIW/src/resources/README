Loading models to caDSR


- Have caDSR database installed: http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR
- Have Java 1.4+ install http://java.sun.com
- Have ant installed: http://ant.apache.org/
- Download cadsr api tarball, untar
- Change cadsrapi/properties/spring/applicationContext.xml to point to your database.: http://www.springframework.org/
- run dist ant task
- Download umlLoader tarball, untar
- copy cadsr/dist/cadsr-api.jar to umlLoader/lib
- Prepare for a load: 
  - $>cd umlLoader
  - $>cp example.build.properties build.properties
  - $>cp example.input.properties input.properties
- copy your annotated XMI file to a directory of your choice, include the full path to that directory in build.properties as dir=/your/path.

- Enter a runtime parameter line in the UML_DEFAULTS table. 
- Use the data you just created and insert it to you build.properties. At this point, build.properties might look like this
       dir=~/data
       projectName=myProject
       projectVersion=1
- create a user in caDSR for the load
- Assign your new user sufficient privileges based on your settings.
- place user credentials in input.properties. Alternatively, you may run umlLoader without ant and enter those credentials at run-time.
- update umlLoader/properties/log4j.properties to your liking. http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/
- run UML Loader. 
    $> ant run
